Cross-Plataform JSLint Support for Sublime Text Editor 2 using Rhino
========================

JSLint is an indispensable tool if you're serious about your JavaScript code quality. This project provides a cross-plataform build script which helps Sublime Text 2 to check JSLint Build System when youâ€™re working within a JavaScript file.

After modifying for your system, save the file to the default path Sublime Text 2 brings up in the save dialog and restart Sublime. Open up a .js file and hit CMD+B, or use Tools > Build. An inline prompt will appear giving you the JSLint results:
